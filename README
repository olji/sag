# SAG

This is the best(pun intended) program you've ever seen.

Actually, it's likely horrible and broken. Hence it's proprietary.

If you really want to use it, consider calling __1-800-DON'T-CUT__ first, in order to get information of better choices in life.

Other than that I can't really help you.
